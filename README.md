# HeavenFox Operation System
# 
# Note:
    HeavenFox OS aims to simplify the Linux kernel by refering to the kernel mechanism,
    which is convenient for the developers to research and apply, and the project follows
    the GPL license and is open source for life.

# Feature:
    01) support multithreading (time slice, priority preemption, and delayed sleep);
    02) support initcall implicit initialization;
    03) support character device driver framework;
    04) support framebuffer driver framework;
    05) support IRQ virtual interrupt numbers mapping (GIC_SPI);
    06) support timer link list (timer_list);
    07) support SD Card (porting fatfs);
    08) support Device Tree (support reading .dtb in SD Card, and parsing it to device_node and platform_device);
    09) support platform: bus - device - driver framework;
    10) provide APIs such as open/close/read/write, access hardware through "fd" and "file_operations";
    11) support flexible selection of source files to be complied through Makefile;
    12) support pinctrl, gpio (and gpio-irq), clock subsystem;
    13) support i2c bus framework: adapter - client - driver;
    14) support workqueue, mutex lock, spin lock and mailbox (inter-thread communication, e.g, ITC);
    15) support waitqueue, semaphore;
    16) support DTC compiler, dtb can be generated by "make dtbs";
    17) support virtual file system (kset, kobject and inode);
    18) support touchscreen driver of "tsc2007", environment sensor driver "ap3216c", eeprom driver "at24c02"
    
# Methods:
    make:           build the whole project;
    make dtbs:      build device-tree only;
    make clean:     delete all the .o and .d;
    make distclean: delete the ./objects/* and .elf, .dis, .img;
    
    or using cmake:
    mkdir -p ./build
    cd ./build
    make distclean
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug ..
    make
    
    Image path: ./boot/HeavenFox.img
    Dtbs  path: ./boot/firmware.dtb
    
# Folder Instruction:
    boot/:          containing device-tree, memory resources and OS image;
    configs/:       optional feature configurations (by setting macro definitions);
    build/:         for CMake (perhaps you can create it by "mkdir -p ./build";
    document/:      instuction documents;
    scripts/:       some tools for compiling or debugging, such as dtc, jlink scripts, ..., and Makefile.build;
    objects/:       when you build the project, the generated intermediate files will be stored here;
    
    application/:   for users (reserved);
    arch/:          cpu architecture related files, contain chip-startup, vector table and register definitions for each cpu, ...;
    board/:         specific board related files, contain direct operations on board resources;
    common/:        the generic definitions and functions, which are applied to all files;
    drivers/:       the hardware drivers for each chip and board perephral;
    example/:       application instances;
    include/:       headers for the whole project;
    init/:          global initialization, such as "main.c";
    kernel/:        for multi-thread features, containing scheduler, and generic threading methods;
    platform/:      the generic abstract framework for system operations, provides methods to standardize programming specifications;
    fs/:            file system related files
